The folders contain some neat themes the dock on Mac OS X.

Scurve is the theme osx 10.5 came with.

To use, open a terminal and cd to this directory (assuming you've
cloned this git archive). Once there, choose the theme and cd into
that directory. From inside, type "sudo ../install". It requires
root privileges to modify the dock.
